So we basically want you to be able to automate any knob or slider right. The
general idea is that we normalise it so -1 is always the lowest value of the
knob/slider and 1 is always the highest and then you have to get it to whatever
level it's really meant to be.

Anyway so we need some sort of data setup so that when something is hooked up
to a parameter we know and can read from that buffer, but if not we have got a
value set on the actual ui or whatever that we can read.

Well then again it's pretty common to have both, where the automation is centred
around the value on the knob and also you can scale how powerful the automation
is. We will not have scaling of the power. It doesn't make sense in our context
and you could just use some kind of maths node (or more ideally a volume control
inside whatever is generating the waveform), but yeah we want the value coming
in plus whatever the knob value is, and then after that we denormalise it.

So, how do we keep track of this stuff and deal with it efficiently?


actually you know what, fuck parameter automation. If I want to automate a
certain thing or add an option to do so I can just add a normal audio input
but to do so for everything just makes it slower and more complex.
