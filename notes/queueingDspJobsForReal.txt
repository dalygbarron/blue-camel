Ok so we have two useful ideas to make this work well and fast.

part one is that we add ALL the dsp jobs to the work queue at the same time and
make the first part of every DSP job be waiting for the dependencies to
finish.

Of course this could easy cause resource starvation except for this next part
which is that we keep all of the modules in a list that is sorted by how many
dependencies they have (recursively), and that is the same order by which they
are added to the work queue each time.


!!!!!!!!
no wait I thought of a better idea that doesn't require sorting.
We just make it that if a dsp job doesn't have it's dependencies sorted out yet
it just ends the job and puts itself back onto the end of the queue.
